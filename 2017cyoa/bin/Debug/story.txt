0|You are an Ex-NSA Hacker and have moved to Australia. You are looking for a job, and do some casual pentesting for small businesses. You sometimes do some private pentesting, where you are trying to explore vunerabilities in large cooperations. You manage to find a huge break in the Commonwealth Bank of Australia's infastructure. What do you do?|1|Exploit the vunerability and become filthy rich (risky)|1|2|Report the finding to the Commonwealth Bank of Australia|5|3|Don't do anything|2|0.png
1|You decide to exploit the vunerability you found. However, you realise that this was a massive mistake.
