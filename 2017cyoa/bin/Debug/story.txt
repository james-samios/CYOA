5|You have decided to come clean and wait for the authorities. You remain in the cafe and have been waiting for 15 minutes. You are now starting to believe that they won't show up. What do you do?|13|Remain waiting for the authorities|12|Run, don't look back|14|Attempt the exploit again with the cafe's free computer, as you believe that you can fully break the honeypot and steal money.
6|You have decided to make up a story. You wait for the authorities to show up, and they arrest you. You are in the interview room and tell them that you were threatened to do it.

What do you do?|19|Park the car and question the officers|20|Park and go inside, pretending they are not there|21|Keep driving
9|You have decided to tell the bank that you knew about the exploit. They ask you why you didn't report it before. What do you say?|22|Tell them you were going to but got sidetracked|23|Tell them you thought you would get in trouble|17|Don't answer the question
10|You have decided to not tell the bank that you knew about the exploit. This choice left the bank with no information about the exploit, which leads to another 3 hacks in the coming week. The bank has lost 300 million dollars. This choice was not correct.|0|START AGAIN|0|START AGAIN|0|START AGAIN
